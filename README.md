# Vigor

The absence of research and statistics in the world of fitness led us to developing this app at [AngelHack, Manipal](http://www.hackathon.io/ahmanipal2016).
While taking minimal user input, this app allows you to :

* Track your satisfaction with your workout regimen
* See what others feel about various training programs
* Rate your programs, not on a traditional scale, but give feedback in sentence form
* Know the completion statistics of various training programs

### Components include

* [Apple's ResearchKit](https://github.com/ResearchKit/ResearchKit) to gather user data and plot charts and graphs accordingly
* [Sentimental Analysis by Haven on Demand](https://dev.havenondemand.com/apis/analyzesentiment) to map feedback to corresponding scores
